Enjoyed Every bit of the movie but after spending nearly three and half hours on it there should be atleast some closure.  I know Pushpa getting his Surname is closure but it isn't satisfactory as there many of the conflicts hasn't been resolved. Don't know why the makers are diluting the story for more parts and collections. The most disappointing part is they made clown out Banwar Singh Shekhawat's character, I expected there would be much more scenes between Pushpa and Banwar Singh. But instead Second half runs on a very generic note. Not upto Sukumar's standards. And Allu Arjun's performance is literally amazing throughout the movie.",,2024-12-05

By the end, I feel the antagonist won because he did died in fear but leaving the protagonist consumed by guilt. Instead of acting justly and handing him over to the police, the protagonist pursued revenge, ultimately leading to his sister-in-law's death and turning himself into a monster in the process.

Despite the moral complexity, the movie is brilliant‚Äîcinematography, music, and lighting are all top-notch. A dark, gripping masterpiece!""",,2024-12-13
