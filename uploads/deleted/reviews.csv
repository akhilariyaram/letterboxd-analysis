This movie had potential to be great, but it falls short and feels incomplete. I liked some funny and emotional moments, but overall, it's lacking that special touch. With a bit more work, it could have been significantly better. Ultimately, it's worth a single watch.</i>",,2023-08-11

This movie kicks off without any time wasted. The characters and their development are impressively written. The first half is thrilling, but I found some scenes in the second half predictable. However, they managed to keep the suspense intact from the pre-climax. Overall, it's a solid crime thriller.</i>",,2023-08-13
